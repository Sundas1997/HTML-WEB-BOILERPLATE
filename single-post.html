                    “Not your keys, not your crypto” is an adage derived from the Proof of Keys concept, which discourages the dependence on exchanges for the storage of one’s crypto assets and promotes self-storage instead. Securing your private keys is critical to ensuring
                    your financial freedom. Unfortunately, most people outsource this responsibility to exchanges, believing that their money is in good hands. But numerous security breaches in the past few years have proven without a doubt that this
                    couldn’t be further from the truth.

                <p>
                    When Mt. Gox, the first crypto exchange, was hacked in June 2011, around 850,000 BTC (worth roughly $450 million then) was stolen from its users. This event nearly crippled the crypto industry since the exchange held most of the Bitcoin available at that
                    time. Several years later, crypto platforms have advanced their cybersecurity mechanisms to great lengths. Unfortunately, hackers are still able to keep up. In fact, their numbers have grown significantly as the popularity and market
                    value of cryptocurrencies exploded. Furthermore, cyber theft is not limited to these so-called ‘centralized exchanges’. There have been many cases of stolen funds in decentralized exchanges and DeFi platforms such as Bancor, dForce,
                    and bZx. Bancor, a decentralized trading platform, was also heavily criticized for having the option to freeze its user funds in response to losing $13.5 million in a security breach. The fact that a trading platform that calls itself
                    “decentralized” has the ability to prevent withdrawals is another major reason to secure your funds yourself.

                    Proof of Keys was an idea conceived by cryptocurrency investor and podcaster Tracey Mayer. He initiated a movement that calls for an annual celebration that aims to encourage cryptocurrency investors to withdraw their crypto funds from exchanges and secure
                    them in their own wallets. Crypto exchanges are on the radar screen of the world’s greatest cybercriminals, and hence, pose a high risk to user funds. As a matter of fact, there have been 12 major security breaches and $292 million
                    worth of user funds stolen in 2019 alone. The Proof of Keys movement celebrates our financial sovereignty by letting us keep the keys to our wallets ourselves. That way, we could ensure that no one but us can access our funds.
